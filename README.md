# Bldr - File generator using templates

Bldr (pronounced "builder") is a web application to upload templates and compile files by replacing variables with values. This is meant as a convenient way store and catalog templates and outputs through a database instead of locally on your computer.

### Disclaimer :warning:

I DO NOT PROMOTE THIS AS SOFTWARE AS USING "Best Practices". While I did my best, I am a backend engineer by trade... Primarily a GoLang developer at that :laughing:

This project was a side project to help make generating output files easier. The deployed application is currently set to "invitation-only". The code is available publicly for three reasons:
1. To add more to my portfolio.
2. To help others when building their own web application.
3. For the love of programming and the open source community.

Credit me or not, it does not matter. I just hope this helps! :slightly_smiling_face:
